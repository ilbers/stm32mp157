Alternative package versions for different images

What to test: Different package version in different version of images

How to test:
Build isar.yml (than now includes both  multiconfigs) and look into <ROOTFS>/var/lib/tstpkg/version.

$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ cat build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/var/lib/tstpkg/version
2.0

Expected result:
Value 2.0 should be found.
