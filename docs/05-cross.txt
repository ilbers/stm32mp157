Switch to cross-building

With this change, the custom packages are built with a cross-toolchain
(included in Debian) on the host, which is faster.

What to test: Cross-building qemuarm image, run it.

How to test:
$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ ./kas-container shell isar.yml -c " \
    sudo apt update && \
    sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends qemu-system ovmf && \
    /work/isar/testsuite/start_vm.py -a arm -d bookworm -i isar-image-base \
  "
Debian GNU/Linux 12 localhost ttyAMA0

localhost login: QEMU: Terminated

Expected result:
Test image should be built. Image should be runnable in qemu.

Note: Since there are no custom packages in the image, build time benefit
from cross-building is not big for now.
