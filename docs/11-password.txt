Configure root and isar users

What to test: Creating users, getting target console.

How to test:
Build the image and check "isar" user created
$ grep "^isar" build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/etc/passwd
$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ grep "^isar" build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/etc/passwd
isar:x:999:999:My isar user:/var/lib/isar:/bin/sh

Unpack tar.gz to the target rootfs and boot it.

Expected result:
Login should work.
