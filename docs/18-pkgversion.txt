Build an earlier version of the test package

What to test: Test package 2.0 is built.
  
How to test:
1. Build isar.yml and look into <ROOTFS>/var/lib/tstpkg/version.
2. Build isar.yml (with tstpkg_2.0.yml addition) and look into <ROOTFS>/var/lib/tstpkg/version.

$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ cat build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/var/lib/tstpkg/version
3.0
$ ./kas-container build isar.yml:tstpkg_20.yml
$ cat build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/var/lib/tstpkg/version
2.0

Expected result:
- Value 3.0 should be found for isar.yml target.
- Value 2.0 should be found for isar.yml:tstpkg_20.yml one.
