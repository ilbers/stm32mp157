Build image for ARM

By default, packages built from sources are compiled with an armhf compiler
running under qemu ("native compilation"). The same compiler is used by Debian,
albeit on ARM hardware.

What to test: Building qemuarm image. Running the image in qemu.

How to test:
$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ ./kas-container shell isar.yml -c " \
    sudo apt update && \
    sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends qemu-system ovmf && \
    /work/isar/testsuite/start_vm.py -a arm -d bookworm -i isar-image-base \
  "
Debian GNU/Linux 12 localhost ttyAMA0

localhost login:

Expected result:
Test image should be built. Image should be runnable in qemu.

Note: kas shell + manual bitbake execution should also work.

Note: Since there are no users configured, we can't login/poweroff the machine.
To exit qemu, press "Ctrl-A, X".
