Add Linux kernel recipe

What to test: Building stm32mp1 kernel.

How to test:
Build the image and check rootfs now has a kernel

$ ls -1 build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/boot/
$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ ls -1 build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/boot/
$ ls -1 build/tmp/work/debian-bullseye-armhf/isar-image-base-stm32mp157/1.0-r0/rootfs/boot/
config-6.1.28-isar
initrd.img-6.1.28-isar
System.map-6.1.28-isar
vmlinuz-6.1.28-isar

Unpack tar.gz to the target rootfs.

Expected result:
It should be possible to boot the kernel and user space if we have a working
boot loader.
