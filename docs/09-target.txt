Switch yaml to stm32mp157 target

What to test: Building stm32mp157 image.

How to test:
$ ./kas-container build isar.yml
$ ls -1 build/tmp/deploy/images/stm32mp157/
isar-image-base-debian-bullseye-stm32mp157.dpkg_status
isar-image-base-debian-bullseye-stm32mp157.manifest
isar-image-base-debian-bullseye-stm32mp157.tar.gz

Expected result:
Test image should be built.

Note: There is no kernel and dtb here, so rootfs is not bootable yet.
